If `itemId` is required and the column is non-null, these parameters should stay non-nullable to prevent accidental null calls that silently no-op. If null is intentionally a valid query value, ensure that this new behavior is clearly defined and all call sites handle it consciously.\n\nSuggested implementation:\n\n```\n    @Query(\"DELETE FROM saved\")\n    fun deleteAll(): Int\n\n```\n\n```\n    @Query(\"DELETE FROM saved WHERE itemid = :itemId\")\n    fun deleteByItemId(itemId: String): Int\n\n```\n\n```\n    @Query(\"SELECT * FROM saved WHERE itemid = :itemId\")\n    fun selectByItemId(itemId: String): LiveData<SavedStory?>\n\n```\n\nIf the actual `selectByItemId` return type differs (e.g. `SavedStory?` vs `List<SavedStory>` vs `SavedStory`), adjust only the parameter type from `String?` to `String` while keeping the existing return type. Also ensure any call sites that were passing nullable strings are updated to handle null explicitly (e.g. by early-returning or filtering out nulls) before calling these DAO methods.\n</issue_to_address>\n~~~\n\n</details>\n\n***\n\n<details>\n<summary>Sourcery is free for open source - if you like our reviews please consider sharing them ✨</summary>\n\n- [X](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=I%20just%20got%20an%20instant%20code%20review%20from%20%40SourceryAI%2C%20and%20it%20was%20brilliant%21%20It%27s%20free%20for%20open%20source%20and%20has%20a%20free%20trial%20for%20private%20code.%20Check%20it%20out%20https%3A//sourcery.ai)\n- [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/share?text=I%20just%20got%20an%20instant%20code%20review%20from%20%40SourceryAI%2C%20and%20it%20was%20brilliant%21%20It%27s%20free%20for%20open%20source%20and%20has%20a%20free%20trial%20for%20private%20code.%20Check%20it%20out%20https%3A//sourcery.ai)\n- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https://sourcery.ai)\n- [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://sourcery.ai)\n\n</details>\n\n<sub>\nHelp me be more useful!

The comment also seems speculative - it says \"consider changing\" rather than pointing to a definite error. Using nullable parameters in DAO methods is actually a common pattern in Room to allow querying with null values. Without strong evidence that this is causing actual problems, this comment appears to be speculative advice rather than pointing to a clear issue. Could the nullable parameter actually be intentional design to handle cases where itemId might be null? The comment mentions \"type mismatch errors in callers\" but I haven't seen evidence of these errors - they might exist in other files not shown in the diff. Even if there are errors in caller files, this violates the rule about cross-file issues - I should only focus on this file. The comment is making assumptions about the entity definition and caller code that I cannot verify from the diff. This appears to be speculative advice rather than a clear, demonstrable issue in the changed code. This comment should be deleted. It makes claims about type mismatches and entity definitions that cannot be verified from the provided diff. It's speculative advice that requires cross-file context to validate, and there's no strong evidence of an actual problem in the code being changed.\n> \n> \n> </details>\n> \n> <details>\n> <summary>2. <code>app/src/main/java/io/github/hidroh/materialistic/data/FavoriteManager.kt:330</code></summary>\n> \n> - **Draft comment:** \n> There is a nullability mismatch when calling dao.deleteByItemId: a nullable String is being passed, but the DAO expects a non-null value.

Since these DAO methods return Cursor, consider annotating them with @RewriteQueriesToDropUnusedColumns to drop unused columns, or revise the return type (e.g. to a typed list) if possible.\n> - **Reason this comment was not posted:**\n> Decided after close inspection that this draft comment was likely wrong and/or not actionable: usefulness confidence = 10% vs. threshold = 50% The comment claims there's a Room/KSP error. If this is true, it would be a compilation error that would be caught by the build. According to the rules, I should NOT comment on anything that would be obviously caught by the build. If Room/KSP is actually reporting an error, the build would fail and the author would see it immediately. The comment is speculative about a potential error rather than pointing to a definite code issue. Without seeing actual build output showing this error, I cannot confirm the comment is correct. The code looks syntactically valid - Room does support Cursor return types. Maybe the reviewer has actually seen a build error and is trying to help fix it? Perhaps this is based on real evidence from running the build, not speculation. The comment does provide a specific, actionable suggestion with the annotation. Even if there is a build error, that would be caught by the build process itself, which the author would see. The rules explicitly state not to comment on things that would be obviously caught by the build. If there's no build error and this is speculative, then it's definitely not useful. Either way, this comment should be removed. This comment should be deleted because it either refers to a compilation error that would be caught by the build (violating the rule about not commenting on things caught by the build), or it's speculative about a potential error without strong evidence. Without seeing actual build output, I cannot confirm this is a real issue.\n> \n> \n> </details>\n> \n> \n> Workflow ID: <workflowid>`wflow_MFDo1OBYcLqsfm0q`</workflowid>\n> </details>\n> \n> <sup>You can customize </sup>[<img alt=\"Ellipsis\" src=\"https://img.shields.io/badge/Ellipsis-blue?color=175173\">](https://www.ellipsis.dev?ref=sheepdestroyer%2Fmaterialistic&utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral)<sup> by changing your [verbosity settings](https://app.ellipsis.dev/sheepdestroyer/settings/code-review), reacting with :+1: or :-1:, [replying to comments](https://docs.ellipsis.dev/features/code-review#teaching-ellipsis), or adding [code review rules](https://app.ellipsis.dev/sheepdestroyer/code-review/rules).</sup>","state":"COMMENTED","html_url":"https://github.com/sheepdestroyer/materialistic/pull/38#pullrequestreview-3663007834","pull_request_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sheepdestroyer/materialistic/pulls/38","author_association":"NONE","_links":{"html":{"href":"https://github.com/sheepdestroyer/materialistic/pull/38#pullrequestreview-3663007834"},"pull_request":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/sheepdestroyer/materialistic/pulls/38"}},"submitted_at":"2026-01-14T21:58:20Z","commit_id":"0a8ed03a2192dc2965bbd527915c2b712c85a97d"},{"id":3663008251,"node_id":"PRR_kwDOQBDOvc7aVRH7","user":{"login":"gemini-code-assist[bot]","id":176961590,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOCow4Ng","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/956858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gemini-code-assist%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/gemini-code-assist","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gemini-code-assist%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gemini-code-assist%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gemini-code-assist%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gemini-code-assist%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gemini-code-assist%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gemini-code-assist%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gemini-code-assist%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gemini-code-assist%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gemini-code-assist%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"body":"## Code Review\n\nThis pull request successfully migrates the project from Kapt to KSP for Room and Dagger, which is a great step for improving build performance.

The comment is flagging \"Develocity\" as a potential typo. However, Develocity is the actual name of Gradle's enterprise platform (it was rebranded from Gradle Enterprise to Develocity). This is standard Gradle output text, not something the developer wrote. The comment is incorrect - there is no typo here. Additionally, this is just a log file output, not actual code, so even if there were a typo, it wouldn't be something the developer could fix since it's generated by Gradle itself. Could \"Develocity\" be a less common term that the automated tool didn't recognize? Maybe the tool is flagging it because it's not in a standard dictionary, but that doesn't mean it's wrong in this context. Even if \"Develocity\" is an uncommon term, it is the correct and official name of Gradle's product. The comment is asking to verify or correct it, but there's nothing to correct. This is generated Gradle output, not user-written code, so the comment is not actionable. This comment should be deleted. \"Develocity\" is the correct name for Gradle's enterprise platform and appears in standard Gradle output.

Room expects non-null values for columns that are defined as non-null, and this change will resolve the type mismatch errors reported by KSP.\n> - **Reason this comment was not posted:**\n> Decided after close inspection that this draft comment was likely wrong and/or not actionable: usefulness confidence = 20% vs. threshold = 50% The comment is making a specific technical claim about Room/KSP type mismatches. However, I cannot verify this claim from the diff alone - I would need to see the SavedStory entity definition to know if itemid is nullable or not. The comment also mentions \"errors reported by KSP\" but there's no evidence of actual errors in the provided context. The fact that the author chose to use nullable types might be intentional - perhaps itemid can be null in some contexts, or perhaps the author is being defensive. Without seeing the actual entity definition or compilation errors, I cannot confirm this is a real issue. The comment could be correct if the SavedStory entity defines itemid as non-null, which would be a legitimate type safety improvement. The author might have simply overlooked this detail when writing the DAO methods. Room does prefer matching nullability between entity fields and query parameters. While the comment might be technically correct, I cannot verify it from the diff alone. The rule states I must see STRONG EVIDENCE that the comment is correct, and I should delete comments that require more context from other files. Since I would need to see the SavedStory entity definition to confirm this, and there's no visible compilation error in the diff, this comment should be deleted. Delete this comment because verifying its correctness requires seeing the SavedStory entity definition from another file, which violates the \"ignore cross-file issues\" rule.

This is standard output from Gradle itself, not something the developer wrote. The comment is asking to verify or correct something that is already correct. Additionally, this is a build log file - it's generated output, not source code that should be edited. The comment violates multiple rules: it's asking the author to verify/confirm something, it's about generated output rather than code changes, and it's simply wrong about \"Develocity\" being unusual or incorrect. Could \"Develocity\" be a recent rebrand that I'm not aware of, making this legitimately confusing? However, even if it were confusing, this is a generated build log file, not something the developer should edit. Even if Develocity were an unusual name, this is generated Gradle output in a build log file.

I'm impressed with the thoroughness of the changes. Not only did you refactor `SavedStoriesDao` to Kotlin to solve the KSP compatibility issues, but you also took the initiative to address several other important points, such as replacing deprecated `Handler` constructors and `overridePendingTransition` calls, and crucially, updating all usages of the unsafe `getAdapterPosition()` to `getBindingAdapterPosition()` in the RecyclerView adapters. These changes significantly improve the codebase's correctness and maintainability.

Also, switching to preference-ktx is a solid improvement. Ensure that any remaining kapt references are removed.\n> - **Reason this comment was not posted:**\n> Comment did not seem useful. Confidence is useful = `0%` <= threshold `50%` The comment is asking the author to ensure that all references to 'kapt' are removed after a change, which violates the rule against asking the author to ensure something. The second part of the comment is purely informative about switching to 'preference-ktx'.\n> \n> \n> </details>\n> \n> <details>\n> <summary>2. <code>app/src/main/java/io/github/hidroh/materialistic/BaseStoriesActivity.java:62</code></summary>\n> \n> - **Draft comment:** \n> The Handler is now correctly instantiated with the main looper, ensuring UI thread safety.\n> - **Reason this comment was not posted:**\n> Confidence changes required: `0%` <= threshold `50%` None\n> \n> \n> </details>\n> \n> <details>\n> <summary>3. <code>app/src/main/java/io/github/hidroh/materialistic/DataModule.java:213</code></summary>\n> \n> - **Draft comment:** \n> The SavedStoriesDao is now imported from its standalone Kotlin file rather than defined as an inner interface.

Please verify if this should be corrected (e.g., to \"Gradle\" or another intended term).\n> - **Reason this comment was not posted:**\n> Decided after close inspection that this draft comment was likely wrong and/or not actionable: usefulness confidence = 0% vs. threshold = 50% This comment is clearly incorrect. \"Develocity\" is not a typo - it's the official name of Gradle's enterprise platform. The build log is generated output from Gradle itself, not something the developer wrote. Even if it were a typo (which it isn't), this is a build log file that is generated automatically, not source code that should be edited. The comment violates multiple rules: it's about generated output (not code changes), it's factually wrong about \"Develocity\" being a typo, and it's not actionable since you don't edit build logs. This should definitely be deleted. Could there be a scenario where the developer intentionally created this build log file and the comment is suggesting they fix the content before committing it? Perhaps the tool thinks build logs shouldn't be committed at all? Even if the concern is about committing build logs, the comment specifically claims \"Develocity\" is a typo, which is factually incorrect. The comment doesn't suggest removing the build log file - it suggests \"correcting\" valid Gradle output. This is clearly a mistaken comment that should be removed. This comment should be deleted. It incorrectly identifies \"Develocity\" as a typo when it's actually the correct official name of Gradle's enterprise platform. Additionally, this is generated build output, not editable source code, making the comment not actionable.\n> \n> \n> </details>\n> \n> <details>\n> <summary>13. <code>build_log_verify.txt:56</code></summary>\n> \n> - **Draft comment:** \n> It appears that the word \"Develocity\" might be a typographical error.
