The approach of using RxJava's `Completable` to move the database write to an IO thread is correct and well-implemented. The addition of a `destroy()` method and the use of `CompositeDisposable` for managing disposables are excellent for handling the component's lifecycle and preventing resource leaks. I have one suggestion to further improve resource management by ensuring all subscriptions are tracked.","state":"COMMENTED","html_url":"https://github.com/sheepdestroyer/materialisheep/pull/48#pullrequestreview-3675202948","pull_request_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sheepdestroyer/materialisheep/pulls/48","author_association":"NONE","_links":{"html":{"href":"https://github.com/sheepdestroyer/materialisheep/pull/48#pullrequestreview-3675202948"},"pull_request":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/sheepdestroyer/materialisheep/pulls/48"}},"submitted_at":"2026-01-18T03:57:14Z","commit_id":"03f9f75b9ed291ebaa977be6f1a55d0e1aa6c4f0"}
